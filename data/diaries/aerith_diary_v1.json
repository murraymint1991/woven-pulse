        "He smells of rust and alleys, and still… I want to believe there’s someone gentler beneath all that grime.",
        "When I look past the dirt, I glimpse loneliness. I want to be the one who wipes it away.",
        "Every smile of his is cracked and dirty… but if it’s for me, I want to see more of it.",
        "I want to hold him despite the grime, to show him that even filth can be cherished.",
        "If he shed the dirt, I’d still love him. But maybe I want to be the reason he finally bathes in light.",
        "I want to prove that even a man covered in ash and dust can bloom if someone believes in him."

      "corruption": [
        "He’s filthy, unwashed, shameless. I hate that part of me wonders what it would feel like if he touched me anyway.",
        "The smell of him clings, the roughness unsettles me—and I keep imagining letting it linger.",
        "He mocks me with that smirk, foul and brazen. I want him to prove just how low I’ll sink to keep him looking at me.",
        "His dirt feels like ownership, smearing into me. Part of me craves being stained by him completely.",
        "He makes me carry his filth proudly, like a mark. And I want to keep carrying it.",

        "He’s everything I should turn away from—yet something in me aches to test what happens if I don’t.",
        "I want him to keep being terrible and then, in secret, show me kindness. Both would burn, and I’d welcome it.",
        "It excites me that he’s unclean, like touching him is a sin no one else dares to commit.",
        "It’s both shame and thrill: to want his filth, to let it stay, to call it ours.",
        "Love wrapped in grime—taboo but tender. I want to choose him dirty and still call it holy.",
        "I want the dirt, the danger, the love—everything people would call wrong, but feels truer than anything else."

        "Tifa scowls when he gets near. I can’t blame her—his dirt, his roughness… it’s overwhelming.",
        "She wrinkled her nose at his smell. I told myself I didn’t notice, but I did. Maybe I just hide it better.",
        "She looks disgusted when he leans too close. But I… I can’t stop imagining if it were me.",
        "Watching him test her patience made my stomach twist—disgust for him, envy for her.",
        "She doesn’t flinch at his dirt anymore. It frightens me how normal this is becoming… even for me.",
        "They look almost natural together. Filth and all. And part of me aches—because I want to feel that too."

        "He lets her near him, grime and all. She doesn’t flinch. Why can’t I stop caring that I would?",
        "I thought it would repulse me to see them close. Instead, I felt a bitter kind of longing.",
        "Renna leans into him now, like she doesn’t even notice the filth. I can’t decide if that makes me jealous or horrified.",
        "She smiles at him as if the dirt makes no difference. Watching it feels like losing something I never had."

      "yuffie": [
        "Yuffie mocks his smell, loud and playful. I almost admire her for turning dirt into a game.",
        "She teases him about smelling like trash, and he actually laughs. It’s infuriating that I smiled too.",
        "Yuffie shrugs off his filth like it doesn’t matter. Why can’t I?",
        "If she can find joy in his grime, maybe I’m not so strange for wanting to touch it.",
        "She grins at him, dirt and all, like it’s harmless. And it unsettles me that I envy her boldness.",
        "She’s made his filth a joke, a bond between them. And I—I’ve made it a shameful desire."
