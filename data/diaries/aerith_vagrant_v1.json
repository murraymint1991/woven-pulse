      "I shouldn’t look twice at a man like him… yet something gentle flickers beneath the grime, and I want to see it again.",

      "I don’t mind the dirt if the smile is real. I want to be the reason it is.",
      "I want quiet mornings and honest evenings—no bravado, just us breathing the same air.",
      "I want to stand beside him in the open, unashamed, and call what we have by its name.",
      "I choose him, not a cleaned-up fantasy—him, as he is, and I’ll meet the world’s doubts with my certainty.",
      "I want a life woven with his: shared work, shared laughter, shared burdens, and a key that fits both our doors.",
      "Let them whisper. I know what I feel. My heart doesn’t want a savior or a project—it wants him.",

      "The shame fades faster now, replaced by heat that lingers. I invite it to stay.",
      "I crave the power of surrender, the rush of being chosen and claimed—no excuses, no masks.",
      "It’s not that I’ve lost myself; it’s that I’ve discovered a self that reaches back when darkness reaches for me.",

      "Stage 2 — She holds herself tall, but I catch her eyes flickering. Why does it sting that she notices him?",
      "Stage 3 — Watching him test her patience twists my stomach. Disgust… and something hotter I don’t want to name.",
      "Stage 4 — I saw her lean just a little closer. I shouldn’t care, but I do. My cheeks burned hotter than hers.",
      "Stage 5 — They shared a silence too heavy. I imagined breaking it—throwing myself between them.",

      "Stage 1 — She shrugs at the grime like it’s nothing. I envy her blindness.",
      "Stage 2 — She let him sit close, dirt and all. I told myself it was foolish. Secretly, I wished it were me.",
      "Stage 3 — Their playfulness makes me feel left out… but also heated, like I’ve been challenged.",
      "Stage 4 — She leaned into him, bold and smiling. I felt jealousy coil around my ribs.",
      "Stage 5 — Her laughter sounded too intimate. I clenched my fists until my nails hurt.",
      "Stage 6 — He brushed her hair back. The tenderness startled me—it should’ve been mine.",
      "Stage 7 — Renna didn’t resist when he teased her waist. I wanted to scream—or beg to be touched the same.",
      "Stage 8 — She accepts him now without question. I’m sick with envy and sick with desire.",
      "Stage 9 — Watching them play at corruption set my body trembling. I couldn’t breathe until it ended.",
      "Stage 10 — They both turned to me, daring me to join. My shame dissolved. I wanted to."

    "yuffie": [
      "Stage 0 — Yuffie mocked his smell, loud and bold. I smiled when he laughed back. Why did I smile?",
      "Stage 1 — She calls him trash and he smirks anyway. I wish I could be so careless with him.",
      "Stage 2 — She teases, he indulges. Their ease makes me ache—why can’t I play like that?",
      "Stage 3 — When she shoved him playfully, my chest tightened. I wanted to feel his weight too.",
      "Stage 4 — She doesn’t mind the dirt. She laughs through it. I hate that I admire her for it.",
      "Stage 5 — They shared a grin I couldn’t break into. I went home restless and jealous.",
      "Stage 6 — She leaned close, whispering something. My ears burned imagining it was me.",
      "Stage 7 — Yuffie’s boldness scares me. She doesn’t flinch, even when he touches what should be private. My thighs pressed together as I watched.",
      "Stage 8 — They make filth look fun. My shame slips faster each time I witness it.",
      "Stage 9 — Her giggles as he pressed against her body left me breathless. I imagined myself between them.",
      "Stage 10 — They knew I was watching. Neither stopped. I stayed—wanting, burning, ready to step in."
