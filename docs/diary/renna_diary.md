# Renna — Personal Desires (Vagrant)

## Stage 0 — First Impressions
- **Love:** “He’s filthy, crude, and I know I should stay away… but there’s something thrilling about how unrefined he is.”  
- **Corruption:** “The dirt clings to him like a curse. It disgusts me… and yet my stomach flips when I imagine that grime on me.”  
- **Hybrid:** “He’s gross, dangerous, and I tell myself it’s funny. But deep down? I’m curious… maybe too curious.”

---

## Stage 1 — Reckless Curiosity
- **Love:** “I can’t help but wonder if there’s a broken man beneath the filth. My heart whispers I could be the one to see it.”  
- **Corruption:** “Every mocking word, every filthy touch… it makes me want to play along. I hate that I smile when he pushes.”  
- **Hybrid:** “He’s unattractive, yes, but I like how dangerous it feels. Maybe the dirt makes the game even more exciting.”

---

## Stage 2 — Baited & Drawn In
- **Love:** “When he lets his guard down, I feel… special. Even with the grime between us, I want to be closer.”  
- **Corruption:** “The dirt no longer bothers me—it excites me. His filth stains me, and I don’t mind being marked anymore.”  
- **Hybrid:** “It’s disgusting, but I like it. His dirt, his danger… and the way he laughs when I give in.”

---

## Stage 3 — Dangerous Thrill
- **Love:** “I cling to the moments where he’s gentle, because they feel rare and real. I think I’ve fallen for the man behind the filth.”  
- **Corruption:** “The more he dirties me, the more I want it. I’ve stopped fighting. I want to be his toy.”  
- **Hybrid:** “I love how it feels wrong and right at the same time. The dirt, the danger, the warmth—it’s intoxicating.”

---

## Stage 4 — Acceptance
- **Love:** “He’s still filthy, but I don’t care anymore. I’ve accepted him, scars and all, because he makes me feel alive.”  
- **Corruption:** “I’m his witch, bound to his grime and his will. The filth is part of me now, and I ache for it.”  
- **Hybrid:** “I love him in the shadows, I lust for him in the dirt. It’s taboo, it’s filthy, it’s ours.”

---

## Stage 5 — Bound Desire
- **Love:** “Even covered in filth, I choose him. I can’t imagine walking away anymore.”  
- **Corruption:** “I am nothing but his now—his puppet, his plaything. I crave his disgusting seed.”  
- **Hybrid:** “The dirt no longer feels like filth. It feels like belonging. I love him, I crave him, I let him consume me.”

# Renna — Reflections (Vagrant & the Girls)

## Stage 0 — First Impressions
- **On Aerith:** “She’s so kind… of course she pities him. But doesn’t she see how dirty he is?”  
- **On Tifa:** “Tifa just glares at him. She’s strong, but maybe too proud to admit curiosity.”  
- **On Yuffie:** “She laughs at him, calls him gross. But I can tell she’s intrigued too.”

---

## Stage 1 — Early Tensions
- **On Aerith:** “She tries to see the good in him. It makes me wonder if she’s blind, or if I’m missing something.”  
- **On Tifa:** “I think she hates him… but I’ve caught her eyes lingering when he talks. She pretends otherwise.”  
- **On Yuffie:** “Yuffie teases him constantly, but her jokes are too sharp. Maybe she’s covering her nerves.”

---

## Stage 2 — Growing Jealousies
- **On Aerith:** “Aerith looks at him differently now. Softly. I don’t like it. Why does she get that side of him and not me?”  
- **On Tifa:** “Tifa’s disgust is turning into something else… something hotter. She’s fighting herself.”  
- **On Yuffie:** “She acts playful, but the way she blushes tells the truth. Does she even realize it?”

---

## Stage 3 — Rivalry Brews
- **On Aerith:** “She writes about saving him, I just know it. But what if he doesn’t want saving? What if he likes the darkness?”  
- **On Tifa:** “Her anger is turning into passion. It’s obvious. She doesn’t hate him half as much as she says.”  
- **On Yuffie:** “She wants him for herself, I can see it. But she’s too reckless—too obvious.”

---

## Stage 4 — Taboo Acceptance
- **On Aerith:** “She’s given herself over to him. Watching it makes my chest ache—jealousy or desire, I can’t tell.”  
- **On Tifa:** “Even Tifa has stopped resisting. She’s letting him stain her, the same way he did me. Why does that excite me?”  
- **On Yuffie:** “She’s playful even as she lets him touch her. It should feel wrong… but seeing her like that makes me curious.”

---

## Stage 5 — Dark Resolution
- **On Aerith:** “She belongs to him now. And I don’t resent her… because so do I.”  
- **On Tifa:** “Tifa has fallen, too. Once disgusted, now marked like the rest of us.”  
- **On Yuffie:** “Yuffie’s laughter has changed. It’s not teasing anymore—it’s hungry. And I can’t help but want to laugh with her.”
