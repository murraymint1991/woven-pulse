## Stage 0 — First Impressions
- **Love Desire:**  
  “He’s rough, reckless, and everyone tells me to stay away. But I can’t help thinking there’s more to him than he shows… and I want to be the one who sees it.”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “He laughs at me, calls me foolish… and I still blush. Maybe I like it when he teases too much. Maybe I want him to push further.”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “It’s dangerous, but it feels like a game. What if I let him get a little closer, just to see what happens?”

## Stage 1 — Early Bonds
- **Love Desire:**  
  “Sometimes, when he’s not looking, I see something gentler in him. I want to be the reason he softens… the reason he changes.”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “He dares me to do things I shouldn’t. Stealing, lying, letting him touch me where no one else has. I know it’s wrong… but I like how it makes me feel.”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “Every time we meet, I feel like we’re sharing a secret no one else can know. It’s wrong, it’s dangerous… and it’s fun.”

## Stage 2 — Naïve Curiosity
- **Love Desire:**  
  “He let me see a side no one else does. Just a smile, just a word, but it was real. I want to believe I’m special to him.”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “He takes more each time. A touch, a command, a dare… and I obey. I hate that I like it. I hate that I want more.”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “Every dangerous thing we do together makes me laugh, makes me tremble. I know I should be afraid, but instead I can’t wait for the next game.”

## Stage 3 — Escalation
- **Love Desire:**  
  “I feel safe when he’s with me, even if I shouldn’t. I want him to keep choosing me, over and over. Maybe I’m already his.”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “He doesn’t ask anymore — he takes. And I let him. Maybe I need him to. Maybe I need to be wanted this badly, even if it means losing myself.”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “Every ‘no’ becomes a ‘yes’ too easily. I giggle, I play along, and then I can’t stop thinking about what we did. It’s wrong, it’s thrilling, it’s everything I shouldn’t want.”

## Stage 4 — Breaking Point
- **Love Desire:**  
  “Everyone says he’s trouble, but I don’t care anymore. When he’s with me, I feel like the world disappears. I even dream about what it would be like to have a child with him, like we could make something new together out of all this mess.”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “I don’t fight him anymore. I want him to take me however he wants, whenever he wants. If he told me I’d carry his child, I’d nod and smile and tell myself I wanted it too.”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “The thrill, the danger, the way he makes me laugh right before he makes me moan. I love it, I hate it, I want more. Even the thought of him giving me a child feels like a wicked joke I’d never want to end.”

## Stage 5 — Outcomes
- **Love Desire:**  
  “He makes me feel like I was right to believe in him all along. Maybe I can be the one who changes him. If we had a child, it would be proof that even in darkness, we can grow something good.”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “I belong to him now. My body, my heart, my future. If I bear his child, it will be because I wanted nothing else but to be his, completely.”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “I know it’s wrong, I know it’s dangerous… and I don’t care anymore. I love that it’s forbidden. If I carried his child, it would be our wicked little secret, proof of how far I’ve fallen for him.”
