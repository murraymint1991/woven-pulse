# Renna — Desire Journal (Vagrant)

## Stage 0 — First Impressions
- **Love Desire:** “Everyone says he’s bad for me. I keep wondering if there’s a softer version he only shows to people who don’t run.”
- **Corruption Desire:** “He laughs when I blush. I want him to push farther—just to see what it feels like when I stop telling him no.”
- **Hybrid Desire:** “I want the trouble and the tenderness together, like a dare I’m brave enough to accept.”

---

## Stage 1 — Early Bonds
- **Love Desire:** “I want to be the reason he changes his mind about himself—just a little.”
- **Corruption Desire:** “I want him to take the lead and make it easy to follow, even when I know I shouldn’t.”
- **Hybrid Desire:** “I want secret rules that only we know—naughty, sweet, and ours.”

---

## Stage 2 — Naïve Curiosity
- **Love Desire:** “I want his guard to drop because I’m near. I want him to reach for me first.”
- **Corruption Desire:** “I want to be undone by how he looks at me—owned, guided, claimed.”
- **Hybrid Desire:** “I want to hold his darkness close and call it beautiful anyway.”

---

## Stage 3 — Escalation
- **Love Desire:** “I want him to choose me on purpose, not by accident. I want to be the calm he didn’t know he wanted.”
- **Corruption Desire:** “I want to say yes before he asks. I want to belong so completely I stop wondering who I was before.”
- **Hybrid Desire:** “I want to giggle through danger and melt into safety—both, in the same breath.”

---

## Stage 4 — Breaking Point (Commitment & Consequence)
- **Love Desire:** “I want a stubborn, ordinary happiness with him—meals, mornings, promises. I even want the chance to be a mother if our love grows that far.”
- **Corruption Desire:** “I want to carry his mark—inside and out. If he wanted me to bear his child, I’d whisper yes and mean it.”
- **Hybrid Desire:** “I want us to write our own vows in the dark—sacred because they’re secret. Even the idea of a child feels like a perfect, wicked blessing.”

---

## Stage 5 — Outcomes
- **Love Desire:** “I want to prove we can make something gentle from everything rough—maybe even a family.”
- **Corruption Desire:** “I want to be his completely, with nothing left unclaimed. If I carry his child, let it bind me to him for good.”
- **Hybrid Desire:** “I want to be the smile in his storm and the storm in his smile—dangerous, tender, forever ours.”

# Renna — Reflections & Witnessed Interactions

## Vagrant & Aerith
- **Entry 1 (Stage 1):** “She’s gentle in ways I’m not. He watches her softness like it’s a miracle. It makes me feel small—and a little jealous.”
- **Entry 2 (Stage 2):** “When he’s near her, he quiets down. Part of me wants to pull him back by the sleeve and say, ‘Look at me like that.’”
- **Entry 3 (Stage 3 — Jealousy):** “I thought I only wanted his attention. Now I want hers too, or at least her approval. Why does that make my chest sting?”
- **Entry 4 (Stage 4 — Hybrid Temptation):** “A wild thought: maybe I don’t have to lose anything. Maybe there’s a way for all of us to stop pretending.”

## Vagrant & Tifa
- **Entry 1 (Stage 1):** “She’s steel and sunlight; he’s smoke and sparks. Watching them together feels like standing too close to fireworks.”
- **Entry 2 (Stage 2):** “She’s trying to resist him. I can tell. I also see the part of her that doesn’t want to.”
- **Entry 3 (Stage 3 — Conflict):** “If she lets him in, where does that leave me? I want to be brave enough not to flinch.”
- **Entry 4 (Stage 4 — Corruption Awareness):** “When they moved together, it lit something dark in me—envy that tasted like excitement.”

## Vagrant & Yuffie
- **Entry 1 (Stage 1):** “She plays with him like it’s a sport. I laugh, then worry I’m the only one who doesn’t know the rules.”
- **Entry 2 (Stage 2):** “He likes the way she pushes back. It makes me want to learn how to tease without trembling.”
- **Entry 3 (Stage 3 — Jealousy):** “They turn the room into a dare. I want to be daring too, not just obedient.”
- **Entry 4 (Stage 4 — Hybrid Spark):** “Maybe I don’t have to choose between being sweet and being bold. Maybe I can be both—and be chosen anyway.”
