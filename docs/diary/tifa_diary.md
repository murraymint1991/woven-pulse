# Tifa — Personal Desires (Vagrant)

## Stage 0 — First Impressions
- **Love:** “He’s rough, unpolished, and covered in filth. There’s nothing here worth admiring.”  
- **Corruption:** “That grime… it disgusts me. And yet a tiny voice whispers, ‘touch it.’ I push it away.”  
- **Hybrid:** “Unattractive, filthy, dangerous. I should avoid him. But then… why does my chest tighten when his eyes meet mine?”

---

## Stage 1 — Guarded Curiosity
- **Love:** “I keep telling myself I’m better than this… but something about his grit feels real, like he’s survived everything. Maybe I admire that.”  
- **Corruption:** “The dirt on his hands makes me want to recoil… but what if I didn’t? What if I leaned in and let it smear onto me?”  
- **Hybrid:** “I want to hate him. But when he gets too close, my pulse skips. Is it fear… or something else?”

---

## Stage 2 — Tempted Disgust
- **Love:** “He’s still filthy, still wrong. But when I’m alone, I wonder if there’s a man buried under all that grime—someone worth saving.”  
- **Corruption:** “Every touch leaves me dirty, but I don’t resist anymore. The shame is addictive.”  
- **Hybrid:** “I catch myself wanting him even while thinking he’s disgusting. The contradiction only excites me more.”

---

## Stage 3 — Forbidden Pull
- **Love:** “When he’s softer with me, I feel something warm beneath the filth. I never expected tenderness from him.”  
- **Corruption:** “The stink, the dirt, the harshness—it should repel me. But it fuels something darker inside. I ache for it.”  
- **Hybrid:** “It’s both: the grime that disgusts me and the closeness that thrills me. I can’t decide if I want to cleanse him or let him drag me down.”

---

## Stage 4 — Dark Thrill
- **Love:** “I think I see the man he could be. I almost forget the filth clinging to him, because the way he holds me feels honest.”  
- **Corruption:** “The more I taste his dirt, the more I crave it. The taboo isn’t just tolerable now—it’s what I want.”  
- **Hybrid:** “I love him through the grime, I lust for him because of it. Desire feels dangerous… and I don’t care.”

---

## Stage 5 — Reluctant Surrender
- **Love:** “Even with the dirt, even with the scars—he’s become someone I trust. Against all reason, I want him.”  
- **Corruption:** “I belong to him now, dirt and all. I’ve stopped resisting, stopped pretending it isn’t what I crave.”  
- **Hybrid:** “His filth is mine now. I love him, I lust for him, I let him mark me in every way. I can’t turn back.”

## Vagrant & Renna
- **Stage 0:** “Renna’s naïve. She doesn’t understand what kind of man she’s giggling with.”  
- **Stage 1:** “She laughs off his dirt as if it’s nothing. It infuriates me how easy it is for her.”  
- **Stage 2:** “He touches her and she just accepts it. I want to scream… or take her place.”  
- **Stage 3:** “I see the way he looks at her—like he’s already won. It makes me jealous… of both of them.”  
- **Stage 4:** “Renna leans into him now, dirt and all. I hate myself for wanting that too.”  
- **Stage 5:** “She doesn’t see the grime anymore. And I don’t either. Not when I imagine myself where she is.”

## Vagrant & Yuffie
- **Stage 0:** “Yuffie mocks him, loud and brash. At least she sees the dirt for what it is.”  
- **Stage 1:** “She laughs at his filth and he actually laughs back. I clenched my fists without realizing it.”  
- **Stage 2:** “Yuffie shrugs off his stench like it’s just a joke. I wish I could.”  
- **Stage 3:** “If she can play in the dirt with him, maybe I’m weaker for avoiding it.”  
- **Stage 4:** “Her playfulness makes the filth seem harmless. I hate that I admire her boldness.”  
- **Stage 5:** “She’s turned his grime into something fun. And me? I’ve turned it into longing.”
