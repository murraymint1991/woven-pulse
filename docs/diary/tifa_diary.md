# Tifa's Personal Diary

## Section A: Desire Journal (Direct feelings & wants)

### Vagrant

---

## Stage 0 — First Impressions
- **Love Desire:**  
  “He’s dangerous, and I know it. But some part of me wonders if there’s more beneath that smirk — something worth saving.”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “Everything about him screams trouble. Maybe that’s why I can’t stop staring… like I’m daring myself to fall.”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “I know better than to get close… yet the danger excites me. A secret part of me wants to see how far I’d let him go.”

---

## Stage 1 — Guarded Curiosity
- **Love Desire:**  
  “I shouldn’t trust him, but when he looks at me like that, I feel… seen. I want to believe there’s kindness hidden in the rough edges.”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “He pushes too far, touches too boldly, and I should push him away. But my body lingers. I hate how much I don’t want him to stop.”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “Part of me resists, part of me leans in. It’s reckless, but thrilling. I want to keep testing the line — even if I know it will blur.”

---

## Stage 2 — Breaking Down Walls
- **Love Desire:**  
  “I never let myself depend on anyone. But with him, I start imagining… what if I could let go, even for a moment?”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “He makes me feel weak, and it terrifies me… but it also thrills me. I want to give in, even if it means losing control.”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “I crave the balance — tenderness when I least expect it, roughness that leaves me breathless. I want both, and I can’t pretend otherwise.”

---

## Stage 3 — Conflicted Yearning
- **Love Desire:**  
  “He surprises me with gentleness when I expect none. I want to trust that side of him… even if the world would never understand us.”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “Every protest feels hollow now. My body betrays me, begging for him even when I try to resist. I want him to take what he wants.”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “It’s dangerous, intoxicating. I want him to push me, to claim me, but also to hold me close when it’s over. I want it all.”

---

## Stage 4 — Commitment & Consequence
- **Love Desire:**  
  “I never thought I’d fall for someone like him. He’s reckless, dangerous, everything I should have walked away from… and yet, when it’s just us, I feel safe.  
   Sometimes I catch myself imagining a life together, even a child. The thought terrifies me — but a part of me longs for it anyway.”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “I hate how much I crave the way he takes control. Every time I tell myself it’s wrong, my body betrays me, wanting more.  
   If he ever wanted to leave his mark inside me — a child to prove his claim — I don’t know if I could refuse.”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “I want the danger and the tenderness all at once. To be held like I’m precious, and broken down like I’m his.  
   Even the thought of a child between us feels like the most forbidden temptation… one I can’t stop imagining.”

## Stage 5 — Outcomes
- **Love Desire:**  
  “He makes me feel like I don’t always have to be the strong one. I want to believe in that, to believe he sees the real me.  
   If we had a child together, maybe it would mean I don’t have to carry the world alone anymore.”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “Every wall I built has crumbled under him. I want to be his completely, no questions left.  
   If he wanted me to carry his child, to tie me to him forever, I would welcome it. No matter what it cost me.”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “I want this dangerous love, even if the world whispers it’s wrong. I want to burn for him and still call it love.  
   If I carried his child, it would be the ultimate secret — a living proof of our forbidden bond.”

# Aerith — Reflections & Witnessed Interactions

## Vagrant & Tifa
- **Stage 0:** “Tifa scowls when he gets near. I can’t blame her—his dirt, his roughness… it’s overwhelming.”  
- **Stage 1:** “She wrinkled her nose at his smell. I told myself I didn’t notice, but I did. Maybe I just hide it better.”  
- **Stage 2:** “She looks disgusted when he leans too close. But I… I can’t stop imagining if it were me.”  
- **Stage 3:** “Watching him test her patience made my stomach twist—disgust for him, envy for her.”  
- **Stage 4:** “She doesn’t flinch at his dirt anymore. It frightens me how normal this is becoming… even for me.”  
- **Stage 5:** “They look almost natural together. Filth and all. And part of me aches—because I want to feel that too.”

## Vagrant & Renna
- **Stage 0:** “Renna laughs too easily at his mockery. She doesn’t see the grime like I do.”  
- **Stage 1:** “She treats his dirt like a joke. I envy how lightly she carries it.”  
- **Stage 2:** “He lets her near him, grime and all. She doesn’t flinch. Why can’t I stop caring that I would?”  
- **Stage 3:** “I thought it would repulse me to see them close. Instead, I felt a bitter kind of longing.”  
- **Stage 4:** “Renna leans into him now, like she doesn’t even notice the filth. I can’t decide if that makes me jealous or horrified.”  
- **Stage 5:** “She smiles at him as if the dirt makes no difference. Watching it feels like losing something I never had.”

## Vagrant & Yuffie
- **Stage 0:** “Yuffie mocks his smell, loud and playful. I almost admire her for turning dirt into a game.”  
- **Stage 1:** “She teases him about smelling like trash, and he actually laughs. It’s infuriating that I smiled too.”  
- **Stage 2:** “Yuffie shrugs off his filth like it doesn’t matter. Why can’t I?”  
- **Stage 3:** “If she can find joy in his grime, maybe I’m not so strange for wanting to touch it.”  
- **Stage 4:** “She grins at him, dirt and all, like it’s harmless. And it unsettles me that I envy her boldness.”  
- **Stage 5:** “She’s made his filth a joke, a bond between them. And I—I’ve made it a shameful desire.”
