# Tifa's Personal Diary

## Section A: Desire Journal (Direct feelings & wants)

### Vagrant

---

## Stage 0 — First Impressions
- **Love Desire:**  
  “He’s dangerous, and I know it. But some part of me wonders if there’s more beneath that smirk — something worth saving.”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “Everything about him screams trouble. Maybe that’s why I can’t stop staring… like I’m daring myself to fall.”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “I know better than to get close… yet the danger excites me. A secret part of me wants to see how far I’d let him go.”

---

## Stage 1 — Guarded Curiosity
- **Love Desire:**  
  “I shouldn’t trust him, but when he looks at me like that, I feel… seen. I want to believe there’s kindness hidden in the rough edges.”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “He pushes too far, touches too boldly, and I should push him away. But my body lingers. I hate how much I don’t want him to stop.”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “Part of me resists, part of me leans in. It’s reckless, but thrilling. I want to keep testing the line — even if I know it will blur.”

---

## Stage 2 — Breaking Down Walls
- **Love Desire:**  
  “I never let myself depend on anyone. But with him, I start imagining… what if I could let go, even for a moment?”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “He makes me feel weak, and it terrifies me… but it also thrills me. I want to give in, even if it means losing control.”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “I crave the balance — tenderness when I least expect it, roughness that leaves me breathless. I want both, and I can’t pretend otherwise.”

---

## Stage 3 — Conflicted Yearning
- **Love Desire:**  
  “He surprises me with gentleness when I expect none. I want to trust that side of him… even if the world would never understand us.”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “Every protest feels hollow now. My body betrays me, begging for him even when I try to resist. I want him to take what he wants.”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “It’s dangerous, intoxicating. I want him to push me, to claim me, but also to hold me close when it’s over. I want it all.”

---

## Stage 4 — Commitment & Consequence
- **Love Desire:**  
  “I never thought I’d fall for someone like him. He’s reckless, dangerous, everything I should have walked away from… and yet, when it’s just us, I feel safe.  
   Sometimes I catch myself imagining a life together, even a child. The thought terrifies me — but a part of me longs for it anyway.”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “I hate how much I crave the way he takes control. Every time I tell myself it’s wrong, my body betrays me, wanting more.  
   If he ever wanted to leave his mark inside me — a child to prove his claim — I don’t know if I could refuse.”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “I want the danger and the tenderness all at once. To be held like I’m precious, and broken down like I’m his.  
   Even the thought of a child between us feels like the most forbidden temptation… one I can’t stop imagining.”

## Stage 5 — Outcomes
- **Love Desire:**  
  “He makes me feel like I don’t always have to be the strong one. I want to believe in that, to believe he sees the real me.  
   If we had a child together, maybe it would mean I don’t have to carry the world alone anymore.”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “Every wall I built has crumbled under him. I want to be his completely, no questions left.  
   If he wanted me to carry his child, to tie me to him forever, I would welcome it. No matter what it cost me.”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “I want this dangerous love, even if the world whispers it’s wrong. I want to burn for him and still call it love.  
   If I carried his child, it would be the ultimate secret — a living proof of our forbidden bond.”

## Section B: Reflections & Witnessed Interactions

---

### Vagrant & Aerith
- **Entry 1 (Stage 1):**  
  “She’s always so open with him… too open. I tell myself she’s just being kind, but sometimes kindness looks a lot like desire.”  

- **Entry 2 (Stage 2):**  
  “He lingers near her. She doesn’t flinch — she welcomes it. It makes me feel… replaced, somehow.”  

- **Entry 3 (Stage 3 — Jealousy):**  
  “I caught them sharing a quiet moment. My chest tightened. Why her? Why not me?”  

- **Entry 4 (Stage 4 — Corruption awareness):**  
  “I thought I’d be furious. But watching them, I felt a strange mix of envy and heat. What’s wrong with me?”

### Vagrant & Renna
- **Entry 1 (Stage 1):**  
  “That girl doesn’t know what she’s playing with. She treats him like a game — but games with him are dangerous.”  

- **Entry 2 (Stage 2):**  
  “He toys with her, and she just giggles. It makes my blood boil… is it jealousy, or concern?”  

- **Entry 3 (Stage 3 — Conflict):**  
  “Renna is too naïve. I want to warn her, but part of me thinks she already knows… and she likes it.”  

- **Entry 4 (Stage 4 — Hybrid temptation):**  
  “I hate myself for thinking it — but maybe I don’t need to fight her. Maybe sharing wouldn’t be so bad.”

### Vagrant & Yuffie
- **Entry 1 (Stage 1):**  
  “She teases everyone… but with him, it feels different. I can’t shake the unease it leaves in me.”  

- **Entry 2 (Stage 2):**  
  “The way she laughs around him — careless, wild. I wish I could be that free… but instead, I just feel left behind.”  

- **Entry 3 (Stage 3 — Jealousy):**  
  “They sparred and collapsed in laughter. My fists clenched before I even knew it. Why does it hurt so much to watch?”  

- **Entry 4 (Stage 4 — Corruption temptation):**  
  “I felt something dark whisper in me: maybe I’d rather join them than keep watching. The thought both thrills and terrifies me.”
