# Tifa — Personal Desires (Vagrant)

## Stage 0 — First Impressions
“He reeks of dirt and smoke. Every time he draws close, my skin prickles with unease. Why would anyone want that?”

## Stage 1 — Guarded Curiosity
“I hate myself for even noticing… but behind the grime, there’s something raw. My fists clench when he smirks at me, and yet… I don’t look away.”

## Stage 2 — Tempted Disgust
“I tell myself he’s disgusting, but my heart races when his eyes linger. It’s like I want to push him away and pull him closer all at once.”

## Stage 3 — Forbidden Pull
“His rough hands, his unwashed scent—it should drive me mad with disgust. Instead, it makes my breath catch. What is wrong with me?”

## Stage 4 — Dark Thrill
“I can’t stop thinking about the way he makes me feel. His filth doesn’t repel me anymore. It excites me. The danger, the taboo… I want more.”

## Stage 5 — Reluctant Surrender
“He owns me in ways I never imagined I would allow. His dirt, his harshness—it’s all part of him. And somehow… it’s part of me now, too.”

# Tifa — Reflections & Witnessed Interactions

## Vagrant & Aerith
- **Stage 0:** “She’s too kind. Too blind. Can’t she see the filth on his hands?”  
- **Stage 1:** “She smiles at him like the grime doesn’t exist. I envy her ease… or maybe I resent it.”  
- **Stage 2:** “Every time he touches her, I feel both disgust and jealousy. Why do I care?”  
- **Stage 3:** “She accepts his filth with open arms, while I burn inside. It makes me want him all the more.”  
- **Stage 4:** “She doesn’t mind the dirt at all now. And I hate that I wish I could be her.”  
- **Stage 5:** “Aerith looks content in his filth. Watching them, I know I’m lost—because I want that same contentment.”

## Vagrant & Renna
- **Stage 0:** “Renna’s naïve. She doesn’t understand what kind of man she’s giggling with.”  
- **Stage 1:** “She laughs off his dirt as if it’s nothing. It infuriates me how easy it is for her.”  
- **Stage 2:** “He touches her and she just accepts it. I want to scream… or take her place.”  
- **Stage 3:** “I see the way he looks at her—like he’s already won. It makes me jealous… of both of them.”  
- **Stage 4:** “Renna leans into him now, dirt and all. I hate myself for wanting that too.”  
- **Stage 5:** “She doesn’t see the grime anymore. And I don’t either. Not when I imagine myself where she is.”

## Vagrant & Yuffie
- **Stage 0:** “Yuffie mocks him, loud and brash. At least she sees the dirt for what it is.”  
- **Stage 1:** “She laughs at his filth and he actually laughs back. I clenched my fists without realizing it.”  
- **Stage 2:** “Yuffie shrugs off his stench like it’s just a joke. I wish I could.”  
- **Stage 3:** “If she can play in the dirt with him, maybe I’m weaker for avoiding it.”  
- **Stage 4:** “Her playfulness makes the filth seem harmless. I hate that I admire her boldness.”  
- **Stage 5:** “She’s turned his grime into something fun. And me? I’ve turned it into longing.”
