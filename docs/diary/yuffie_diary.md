## Stage 0 — First Impressions
- **Love Desire:**  
  “He’s a total mess. And I like it. Like staring at a bonfire you know will burn you if you get too close — and I kinda wanna jump anyway.”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “He pushes back when I tease, and it makes me want to push harder. What if he caught me off guard? …Why does that thought make me blush?”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “It’s like a game I can’t win, and I love it. He’s the first one who makes me feel like I’m not in control — and maybe I don’t wanna be.”

## Stage 1 — Early Bonds
- **Love Desire:**  
  “He’s trouble, but he’s fun trouble. Every time I’m around him, I can’t stop laughing. Maybe he’s not all bad… or maybe I don’t care if he is.”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “The way he grabs me when I least expect it… it makes my heart race. Not in fear. In something worse. Or better.”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “Every dare he throws my way, I want to beat him at. But secretly, I like losing. It feels… exciting.”

## Stage 2 — Dangerous Fun
- **Love Desire:**  
  “Sometimes I think I see the real him, like a spark under the dirt. I want to be the one who fans it into a flame. …Don’t laugh at me, diary.”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “He doesn’t play fair — and I like that. Every time he wins, I feel like I want him to take more from me. Maybe everything.”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “It’s like stealing from my own heart. Wrong, risky, and I can’t stop myself. If this is a game, I don’t want it to end.”

## Stage 3 — Escalation
- **Love Desire:**  
  “I never thought I’d want to trust him… but I do. When it’s just us, it feels like I can drop the act, like he actually sees me. And I want him to keep looking.”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “He doesn’t ask. He takes. And every time I tell myself I’ll fight back — I don’t. I just melt, and crave more.”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “Every kiss feels like stealing. Every touch feels like a dare. I know it’s wrong, but I can’t stop giggling and leaning in for more.”

## Stage 4 — Breaking Point
- **Love Desire:**  
  “I think about him all the time now. About a life where it’s not just chaos, but something we build together. Even… a child. Spirits, what’s wrong with me?”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “I want him to own me. To leave me marked. If he wanted me to carry his child, I’d grin and say yes, like it was the ultimate prank — on myself.”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “It feels like the ultimate dare. To love him and want him and let the world see what we’ve done. Even a baby between us would feel like a dangerous secret we both brag about.”

## Stage 5 — Outcomes
- **Love Desire:**  
  “He’s the only one who’s ever made me feel this alive. I don’t care if he’s rough, or broken. I want to stay with him. If we had a child, maybe it’d be proof that even chaos can make something worth keeping.”  
- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “I belong to him. And I love it. If carrying his child ties me to him forever, then good. Let everyone see whose I am.”  
- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “I know it’s wrong. I know it’s dangerous. That’s why I love it. If I carried his child, it would be the ultimate victory — proof that I let him steal the one thing I swore I’d never give.”
