# Yuffie — Personal Desires (Vagrant)

## Stage 0 — First Impressions
- **Love:** “Ugh, he’s gross. Dirty, smelly, everything I shouldn’t like. So why do I keep looking at him when I think no one’s watching?”  
- **Corruption:** “Disgusting… and yet, my heart beats faster when he smirks. Maybe it’s because he looks like trouble.”  
- **Hybrid:** “He’s revolting. I hate him. …but why do I want to see how far he’ll go if I let him?”

---

## Stage 1 — Playful Provocation
- **Love:** “I tease him because it’s easy, but maybe I just want his attention. Even when he insults me, it feels like a game.”  
- **Corruption:** “I laugh when he gets bold, but secretly, it excites me. Filthy hands shouldn’t make me shiver… but they do.”  
- **Hybrid:** “I keep calling him a creep, but my smile gives me away. Part of me wants to see what he’ll dare next.”

---

## Stage 2 — Dangerous Curiosity
- **Love:** “I think I see a side of him the others don’t. A lonely man, hiding behind all that filth. I almost… want to comfort him.”  
- **Corruption:** “When he pushes too far, I should fight back… but I don’t. I giggle. I egg him on. Am I broken?”  
- **Hybrid:** “He’s gross, but I like the thrill. I don’t care if it’s wrong—I want more of that dangerous edge.”

---

## Stage 3 — Tipping Point
- **Love:** “I don’t just tease anymore… I want him. Even covered in dirt, I crave the warmth when he’s near.”  
- **Corruption:** “The dirt, the smell, the roughness—it’s addictive. I can’t stop laughing, can’t stop wanting.”  
- **Hybrid:** “I want to love him, I want to hate him, I want him to push me further. It’s wild, it’s wrong, and I love it.”

---

## Stage 4 — Acceptance
- **Love:** “I don’t care what anyone says—I see something good in him. Even filthy, I want him close.”  
- **Corruption:** “I’m his fool now, and I don’t even care. His filth is mine, and I crave every second.”  
- **Hybrid:** “It’s love, it’s lust, it’s corruption—I don’t know. All I know is I don’t want it to stop.”

---

## Stage 5 — Bound Desire
- **Love:** “He’s mine. Even if he’s dirty, even if the world hates us. I don’t care—I love him.”  
- **Corruption:** “I’ve let him ruin me, and it feels like the only way I can breathe.”  
- **Hybrid:** “This isn’t clean love. It’s filthy, it’s taboo, it’s ours. And I wouldn’t trade it for anything.”

# Yuffie — Reflections (Vagrant with Others)

## Vagrant & Aerith
- **Stage 0:** “Of course he hangs around the flower girl. She’s too nice to tell him he stinks.”  
- **Stage 1:** “She doesn’t even flinch at his filth. Maybe she’s braver than I thought… or just too soft.”  
- **Stage 2:** “I caught her smiling at him. Gross. Why does it bug me so much?”  
- **Stage 3:** “She blushes when he’s near, like she’s forgotten how dirty he is. I shouldn’t care, but I do.”  
- **Stage 4:** “She accepts him, grime and all. It makes me wonder… maybe I want that too.”  
- **Stage 5:** “She’s in love with him, filth and everything. I should laugh at her… but deep down, I’m jealous.”

## Vagrant & Tifa
- **Stage 0:** “Tifa looks ready to punch him every time he opens his mouth. Can’t blame her.”  
- **Stage 1:** “She hides her disgust better than me, but I see it. She’s trying not to breathe him in.”  
- **Stage 2:** “She looks… conflicted. Like maybe she wants him to stop, but also wants him to keep going.”  
- **Stage 3:** “She doesn’t look away anymore. Even when he’s too close, she lets it happen. Why does that sting?”  
- **Stage 4:** “She treats him like he belongs near her. That dirt doesn’t even faze her anymore. Maybe it never did.”  
- **Stage 5:** “She’s his now. And all I can think is—I don’t want to be left out.”  

---

## Vagrant & Renna
- **Stage 0:** “That witch doesn’t know what she’s getting into. She thinks it’s all fun.”  
- **Stage 1:** “She laughs when he mocks her. How can she ignore the grime like that?”  
- **Stage 2:** “He touches her more now, and she just goes along with it. My chest felt tight watching.”  
- **Stage 3:** “Renna lets him closer than she should. And I… I can’t stop watching.”  
- **Stage 4:** “She clings to him now. The dirt, the filth—it doesn’t matter to her. Maybe it shouldn’t matter to me either.”  
- **Stage 5:** “She’s his. All of them are becoming his. And the worst part? I think I want to join them.”
