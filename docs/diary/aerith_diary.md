# Aerith — Desire Journal (Vagrant)

## Stage 0 — First Impressions
- **Love Desire:** “He smells of rust and alleys, and still… I want to believe there’s someone gentler beneath all that grime.”
- **Corruption Desire:** “He’s filthy, unwashed, and shameless. I hate that part of me wonders what it would feel like if he touched me anyway.”
- **Hybrid Desire:** “He’s everything I should turn away from—yet something in me aches to test what happens if I don’t.”

---

## Stage 1 — Early Bonds
- **Love Desire:** “When I look past the dirt, I glimpse loneliness. I want to be the one who wipes it away.”
- **Corruption Desire:** “The smell of him clings, the roughness unsettles me—and I keep imagining letting it linger.”
- **Hybrid Desire:** “I want him to keep being terrible and then, in secret, show me kindness. Both would burn, and I’d welcome it.”

---

## Stage 2 — Naïve Curiosity
- **Love Desire:** “Every smile of his is cracked and dirty… but if it’s for me, I want to see more of it.”
- **Corruption Desire:** “He mocks me with that smirk, foul and brazen. I want him to prove just how low I’ll sink to keep him looking at me.”
- **Hybrid Desire:** “It excites me that he’s unclean, like touching him is a sin no one else dares to commit.”

---

## Stage 3 — Escalation
- **Love Desire:** “I want to hold him despite the grime, to show him that even filth can be cherished.”
- **Corruption Desire:** “His dirt feels like ownership, smearing into me. Part of me craves being stained by him completely.”
- **Hybrid Desire:** “It’s both shame and thrill: to want his filth, to let it stay, to call it ours.”

---

## Stage 4 — Breaking Point
- **Love Desire:** “If he shed the dirt, I’d still love him. But maybe I want to be the reason he finally bathes in light.”
- **Corruption Desire:** “He makes me carry his filth proudly, like a mark. And I want to keep carrying it.”
- **Hybrid Desire:** “Love wrapped in grime—taboo but tender. I want to choose him dirty and still call it holy.”

---

## Stage 5 — Outcomes
- **Love Desire:** “I want to prove that even a man covered in ash and dust can bloom if someone believes in him.”
- **Corruption Desire:** “I want to be ruined by him, filth and all, until the world sees me as his and only his.”
- **Hybrid Desire:** “I want the dirt, the danger, the love—everything people would call wrong, but feels truer than anything else.”

# Aerith — Reflections & Witnessed Interactions

## Vagrant & Tifa
- **Entry 1 (Stage 1):** “She wrinkled her nose at his smell. I told myself I didn’t notice, but I did. Maybe I just hide it better.”
- **Entry 2 (Stage 2):** “She looks disgusted when he leans too close. But I… I can’t stop thinking of what it would be like if he leaned closer to me.”
- **Entry 3 (Stage 3):** “Watching him test her patience made my stomach twist—disgust for him, envy for her.”

## Vagrant & Renna
- **Entry 1 (Stage 1):** “She treats his dirt like a joke. I envy how easily she laughs about it.”
- **Entry 2 (Stage 2):** “He lets her near him, grime and all. She doesn’t flinch. Why can’t I stop caring that I would?”
- **Entry 3 (Stage 3):** “I thought it would repulse me to see them close. Instead, I felt a bitter kind of longing.”

## Vagrant & Yuffie
- **Entry 1 (Stage 1):** “She teases him about smelling like trash, and he actually laughs. It’s infuriating that I smiled too.”
- **Entry 2 (Stage 2):** “Yuffie shrugs off his dirt like it doesn’t matter. Why can’t I?”
- **Entry 3 (Stage 3):** “If she can find joy in his filth, maybe I’m not so strange for wanting to touch it.”
