# Aerith's Personal Diary

## Section A: Desire Journal (Direct feelings & wants)

### Vagrant 

---

## Stage 0 — First Impressions
- **Love Desire:** “I want to see the good in him, even if it’s buried deep. Something in me aches to believe he can be more than what he shows.”
- **Corruption Desire:** “I wonder what it would feel like to stop resisting… to let myself be pulled into his darkness instead of pulling him toward the light.”
- **Hybrid Desire:** “I want him to be both danger and comfort. A secret fire only I would dare to hold.”

---

## Stage 1 — Early Bonds
- **Love Desire:** “I want him to open up, to trust me with the parts of himself he hides from the world. I want to be the one he softens for.”
- **Corruption Desire:** “I want the thrill of letting him take what he wants… to feel his claim on me, even if it leaves me trembling.”
- **Hybrid Desire:** “I want to blur the lines with him — where his roughness excites me as much as his rare moments of kindness.”

---

## Stage 2 — Shifting Lines
- **Love Desire:** “I long for the quiet in his eyes when he lets his guard fall, even for a moment. I want to believe those moments are meant only for me.”
- **Corruption Desire:** “I want to be undone by him — to feel how far I can fall before I stop recognizing myself in the mirror.”
- **Hybrid Desire:** “I want to love both his shadows and his light, to cradle the danger as if it were precious.”

---

## Stage 3 — The Tipping Point
- **Love Desire:** “I imagine walking beside him as though he’s been forgiven, as though with me he could finally rest and not fight.”
- **Corruption Desire:** “I want to be marked, owned, shaped by his will… even if it means losing pieces of who I was before.”
- **Hybrid Desire:** “I want a love that feels like temptation itself, where surrender and sanctuary come from the same man.”

---

## Stage 4 — Commitment & Consequence

- **Love Desire:**  
  “I want to build something lasting with him, even if everyone else doubts. A home, a future, a love stubborn enough to survive anything.  
   Sometimes I imagine holding his child… proof that what we share isn’t just fleeting, but the start of a life together.”

- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “I want to belong to him completely — body, soul, every breath claimed so I can’t imagine life without him.  
   Part of me aches to be filled, to swell with his mark, so no one could ever doubt who owns me.”

- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “I want us to write our own rules, where every forbidden touch becomes sacred because it’s ours.  
   Even the thought of carrying his child feels like the sweetest scandal — dangerous, but ours to cherish.”

---

## Stage 5 — Outcomes

- **Love Desire:**  
  “I want him to believe he can be loved, not because he changed, but because I chose every part of him and never let go.  
   If I bore his child, I’d cradle it as proof that love makes even broken things bloom.”

- **Corruption Desire:**  
  “I want to drown in him, to be swallowed whole by his darkness and never look back.  
   To carry his child would be the ultimate surrender — my body branded forever with his will.”

- **Hybrid Desire:**  
  “I want to be his forbidden miracle — the one who embraces both the danger and the tenderness, and calls it love.  
   The thought of a child between us thrills me; scandal to the world, but to us… perfection.”

## Section B: Reflections & Witnessed Interactions

### Vagrant & Tifa
- **Entry 1 (Stage 1):**  
  “The way he looked at her… sharp, hungry. I told myself it didn’t matter, but it stung in a place I didn’t know existed.”  

- **Entry 2 (Stage 2):**  
  “She’s so strong… if he turned that hunger on her, would she resist? Why do I care so much?”  

- **Entry 3 (Stage 3 — Jealousy):**  
  “When she laughed at his joke, I felt a crack inside me. Am I afraid of losing him… or of losing her?”  

- **Entry 4 (Stage 4 — Corruption awareness):**  
  “I caught them alone. His hands were bolder, and she didn’t push him away. The thought twisted me — fear, envy, and heat all at once.”  

---

### Vagrant & Renna
- **Entry 1 (Stage 1):**  
  “She’s so naïve. Watching her hover around him makes me anxious… but also oddly protective.”  

- **Entry 2 (Stage 2 — Jealousy):**  
  “I saw him lean too close to her. My chest burned — anger, worry, maybe even envy. Why do I want to keep him to myself?”  

- **Entry 3 (Stage 3 — Conflict):**  
  “Renna looks at him like a child chasing fireflies. I want to shield her… yet a part of me envies how easily she gives herself to him.”  

- **Entry 4 (Stage 4 — Hybrid trigger):**  
  “When I saw them, I felt torn. I should be furious… but instead, I wondered what it would feel like to share him.”

### Vagrant & Yuffie
- **Entry 1 (Stage 1):**  
  “Yuffie’s playful nature draws everyone in… even him. I laughed it off, but deep inside, I felt uneasy.”  

- **Entry 2 (Stage 2):**  
  “She teases him shamelessly. I tell myself it’s harmless, but what if it isn’t?”  

- **Entry 3 (Stage 3 — Jealousy):**  
  “They sparred today, trading jabs and laughter. My stomach knotted. Is this how it starts — while I’m standing on the sidelines?”  

- **Entry 4 (Stage 4 — Corruption temptation):**  
  “Watching them play made me ache. A thought whispered: maybe I don’t have to fight it… maybe I could be part of it too.”
