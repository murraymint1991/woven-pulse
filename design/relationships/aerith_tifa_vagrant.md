🌸 Aerith ↔ Tifa ↔ Vagrant — Progression Map

This document details the triad relationship progression between Aerith, Tifa, and Vagrant, using the Love / Corruption / Jealousy axes.


---

Stage 0 — First Impressions

Aerith → Vagrant: Sympathetic but wary.

Tifa → Vagrant: Distrustful, cautious.

Vagrant → Aerith/Tifa: Mocking, playful, distrustful.


Systems:

Diary entries note suspicion or curiosity.

Corruption + if Aerith/Tifa tolerate unsolicited comments/touches.

Love + if they show compassion/defend him.



---

Stage 1 — Early Bonds

Aerith and Tifa can separately build trust with Vagrant.

Negative drift if they insult/avoid him.

Soft Lock: Must choose to spend time in slums with him.


Branches:

Love Path: Compassion unlocks small moments of trust.

Corruption Path: Accepting rough advances/shady activities raises tolerance.

Jealousy: Triggered if both show affection → rivalry flags set.


🔒 Pregnancy State: Protected → implied contraception/resistance mechanics. Early intimacy scenes possible, but no pregnancy outcomes yet.


---

Stage 2 — Fork in the Road

Love Path:

Aerith or Tifa may pursue Vagrant alone (exclusive).

Rivalry triggered with the other.


Corruption Path:

Joint participation in Vagrant’s darker activities.

Unsolicited intimacy shifts from resisted → tolerated → enjoyed.


Jealousy + Corruption Path:

Rivalry mutates into shared corruption bond.

Early Dark Trio begins.



🔒 Pregnancy State: Still locked. “Prevented intimacy” flagged in diary (“…we were careful”).


---

Stage 3 — Escalation

Friendship: Aerith or Tifa develops “Stray Companion” bond with Vagrant.

Romance (Love-high, Corr-low): Exclusive partner → fragile but healthy. Rivalry intensifies.

Dark Romance (Corr-high, Love-low): Submission → fully corrupted partner.

Hybrid (Love+Corr-high): Passionate, volatile, unstable bond.

Dark Trio (Love+Corr+Jealousy-high): Both women accept shared intimacy → corrupted trio romance.


🔒 Pregnancy State: Still “soft locked.” Mechanics like corruption not high enough, or implied contraceptive choices prevent outcomes.


---

Stage 4 — Divergences

Healthy Romance: Aerith + Vagrant OR Tifa + Vagrant → stable couple, rival distances.

Corruption-only Resolution: Aerith or Tifa becomes Vagrant’s Plaything. Other distances; party suspicion grows.

Hybrid Resolution: Oscillates between tenderness/toxicity. World gossip notes instability.

Dark Trio Resolution: Aerith + Tifa + Vagrant form corrupted but intimate bond. Unlocks unique trio diary entries and scenes.


🔓 Pregnancy State: Now unlocked.

If corruption or love thresholds are met, pregnancy becomes a possible outcome.

Corruption → darker pregnancy framing (possession, submission).

Love → mutual choice of parenthood.

Trio → duo pregnancies possible.

Possible Outcomes

Healthy Romance: Aerith + Vagrant OR Tifa + Vagrant. Parenthood possible if unlocked.

System Notes

Love Score: Drives healthy intimacy. Counterbalances jealousy.

Corruption Score: Unlocks unsolicited/taboo intimacy, darker alliances, eventual pregnancy tolerance.

Jealousy Trigger: Fires when both Aerith & Tifa pursue Vagrant. Can escalate into rivalry or trio.

Pregnancy Gating:

Stages 1–3 → pregnancy “soft locked” (implied protection mechanics).

Stages 4–5 → pregnancy unlocked, tied to outcome branch (healthy, dark, hybrid, trio).


Shared Corruption Bond: High corruption + jealousy flips rivalry into trio path.

Meta-condition: King of the Slums requires corruption of all female MCs.
