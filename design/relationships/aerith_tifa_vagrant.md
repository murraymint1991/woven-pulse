🌸 Aerith ↔ Tifa ↔ Vagrant — Progression Map

This document details the triad relationship progression between Aerith, Tifa, and Vagrant, using the Love / Corruption / Jealousy axes.


---

Stage 0 — First Impressions

Aerith → Vagrant: Sympathetic but wary.

Tifa → Vagrant: Distrustful, cautious.

Vagrant → Aerith/Tifa: Mocking, playful, distrustful.


Systems:

Initial diary entries written.

Small Corruption + if Aerith/Tifa tolerate unsolicited comments/touches from Vagrant.

Love + if they defend him or show compassion.



---

Stage 1 — Early Bonds

Aerith and Tifa can separately build trust with Vagrant.

Negative drift if they avoid or insult him.

Soft Lock: Engagement required → must choose to spend time in slums with him.


Branch Potential:

Love Path: Compassion unlocks small moments of trust.

Corruption Path: Accepting Vagrant’s rough advances or shady activities raises tolerance.

Jealousy: Triggered if both Aerith and Tifa show affection → rivalry flags set.



---

Stage 2 — Fork in the Road

Love Path:

Aerith or Tifa alone may pursue Vagrant (exclusive romance).

The other character becomes jealous → rivalry begins.


Corruption Path:

Joint participation in Vagrant’s darker activities (thieving, intimidation).

Unsolicited intimacy begins shifting from resisted → tolerated → enjoyed.


Jealousy + Corruption Path:

Instead of rivalry, both women accept sharing Vagrant → early Dark Trio bond forms.




---

Stage 3 — Escalation

Friendship Arc:

Either Aerith or Tifa develops “Stray Companion” bond with Vagrant (trust without romance).


Romance Arc (Love-high, Corr-low):

Aerith–Vagrant OR Tifa–Vagrant → healthy but fragile relationship.

Rivalry intensifies between the women.


Dark Romance Arc (Corr-high, Love-low):

Aerith or Tifa submit to Vagrant’s dominance/manipulation → dark relationship forms.


Hybrid Arc (Love+Corr-high):

Passionate, unstable romance → jealousy and affection intermixed.


Dark Trio Path (Love+Corr+Jealousy-high):

Aerith and Tifa both bond with Vagrant → rivalry mutates into shared corruption romance.

Unlocks unique trio scenes (slum alliances, intimacy events, joint diary reflections).



---

Stage 4 — Divergences

Love-only Resolution:

Aerith or Tifa chosen by Vagrant → exclusive partner.

The other distances → rivalry ending.


Corruption-only Resolution:

Aerith or Tifa become “Darkened Flower” → fully corrupted by Vagrant.

The other breaks ties → suspicion and backlash from party/NPCs.


Hybrid Resolution:

Intense volatile love triangle → unstable, jealous passion continues.

Can tip toward trio path if corruption climbs high enough.


Dark Trio Resolution:

All three form corrupted but intimate bond.

Unique shared ending content (joint home, darker family path, slum reputation shift).



---

Stage 5 — Outcomes & Titles

Possible Outcomes:

Healthy Romance: Aerith + Vagrant OR Tifa + Vagrant.

Rivalry Fallout: Aerith vs. Tifa permanently fractured.

System Notes

Love Score: Drives healthy intimacy, mutual romance.

Corruption Score: Drives tolerance of unsolicited intimacy, taboo acts, dark alliances.

Jealousy Trigger: Arises when both Aerith & Tifa pursue Vagrant → rivalry or trio.

Shared Corruption Bond: When jealousy + corruption are both high, rivalry flips into acceptance of shared romance.

✅ This structure keeps it systemic (stats drive outcomes) but narratively rich (unique outcomes for Love, Corruption, Jealousy, Hybrid, Trio).
✅ Scales to other characters easily (e.g. Aerith ↔ Barret ↔ Cloud, Tifa ↔ Yuffie ↔ Kaien, etc.).

👉 Do you want me to now also redraw this as a Mermaid flowchart (stages + paths) for quick visual clarity, or should we keep this first doc purely text?
