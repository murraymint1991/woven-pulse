🍃 Yuffie ↔ Vagrant — Progression Map

This arc details the relationship between Yuffie and Vagrant, framed through Love, Corruption, Hybrid, and Pregnancy systems.
Unlike Aerith (compassionate) and Renna (naïve), Yuffie approaches Vagrant as a game and rivalry first — which makes her corruption path far more playful and mocking.


---

Stage 0 — First Impressions

Yuffie → Vagrant: Treats him like a challenge. Amused by his crudeness, but sees him as “fun to mess with.”

Vagrant → Yuffie: Intrigued by her energy, sees potential to bend her mischievous streak into something darker.


Systems:

Love + if she admires his “wild freedom.”

Corruption + if she indulges in his crude dares and risky behavior.

Jealousy → potential rivalry with Renna (two playful troublemakers in competition for his attention).



---

Stage 1 — Rivalry & Play

Yuffie teases Vagrant, mocking his slum life.

Vagrant mocks her back → dares, light intimidation, petty games.

Both start with banter-heavy tension.


Branch Potential:

Love: Yuffie admires his grit beneath the dirt → sees him as a “slum survivor worth respecting.”

Corruption: She treats taboo acts like another dare (“bet you won’t touch me there!”).

Hybrid: Yuffie frames intimacy as playful but affectionate, making taboo acts a joke shared between them.


Pregnancy: 🔒 Locked.

Stage 2 — Escalating Dares

Love Path: Vagrant shows hidden protectiveness → Yuffie impressed, diary: “Guess he’s not just trash after all…”

Corruption Path: Dares get intimate → unsolicited touches framed as “jokes.” Yuffie plays along but feels the shift. Diary: “Ugh, he’s awful… but why do I let him?”

Hybrid: Yuffie begins to enjoy taboo teasing, mixing affection with mockery. Diary: “We’re terrible together, fufufu.”


NPC Gossip: People notice them constantly bickering/flirting. NPC: “Those two… always in each other’s hair.”

Pregnancy: 🔒 Still locked.

Stage 3 — Tipping Point

Love: Yuffie admits feelings beneath the banter. Diary: “It’s not just a game anymore… I kinda like him.”

Corruption: Vagrant dominates dares, escalates unsolicited acts → Yuffie tolerates more and more, masking discomfort with jokes. Diary: “Maybe I wanted this all along?”

Hybrid: Yuffie reframes taboo as fun + affection. Diary: “I tease him, he teases me, but we can’t stop.”


Jealousy Triggers:

Yuffie clashes with Renna over “who’s more fun.”

With Aerith/Tifa → jealousy more about attention imbalance than morality.


Pregnancy: 🔒 Until Stage 4.

Stage 4 — Breaking Point

Love Resolution: Yuffie softens, stops joking, shows vulnerability. “Don’t laugh… I actually care about you.”

Corruption Resolution: She’s pulled fully into taboo dares → diary almost complicit: “I’m his partner in crime now. Whatever he wants.”

Hybrid Resolution: Playful corruption becomes their love language. “We’re so bad together… and that’s why it works.”


Pregnancy: 🔓 Now unlocked.

Love → surprise, framed as “starting a new life, somehow.”

Corruption → accepted as “part of the game,” Vagrant frames her as his possession.

Hybrid → half-joking, half-serious: “Oops… guess we weren’t careful.”
