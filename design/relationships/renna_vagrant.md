Diary: “It’s just a game… right?”


Hybrid:

Renna enjoys the taboo playfulness, joking about danger while indulging him.

Diary: “I shouldn’t be enjoying this… but it’s kind of exciting.”

Stage 3 — Escalation

Love (High):

Renna clings to him as a “protector,” affection grows.

NPC gossip: “That girl’s too young-minded to know better.”


Corruption (High):

“If I say no… he might leave. I don’t want that.”


Hybrid (Both High):

Renna embraces the taboo but frames it as fun + affection.

Diary: “We’re so naughty together… but I can't help it any more.”



🔒 Pregnancy State: Locked until Stage 4.
