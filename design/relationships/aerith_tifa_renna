🖤 Quad Arc — Aerith, Tifa, Renna, Vagrant

This arc covers the unique interactions and outcomes when Aerith, Tifa, and Renna are simultaneously entangled with Vagrant.
Progression is stage-gated: all three must reach the minimum threshold before the quad moves forward.
Love, Corruption, and Jealousy shape outcomes, with Pregnancy RNG providing organic variation.


---

Stage 0 — First Impressions

Aerith → Vagrant: Compassionate curiosity. Believes he can be “saved.”

Tifa → Vagrant: Guarded suspicion. Considers him dangerous and beneath them.

Renna → Vagrant: Reckless curiosity. Naïve thrill in his danger.

Vagrant → All: Amused opportunist. Tests boundaries, decides who bends first.


Systems Active:

Jealousy meters set individually (Aerith ↔ Tifa, Aerith ↔ Renna, Tifa ↔ Renna).

Renna more prone to corruption due to naivety.

Aerith more prone to Love progression.

Tifa requires stronger investment (harder Love path).



---

Stage 1–2 — Early Bonds

Aerith ↔ Vagrant: Compassion nurtures trust → Love rises. Diary: “He hides pain under the mockery. I see it.”

Tifa ↔ Vagrant: Distrust holds, but she may respect his rawness. If he pushes corruption, she reacts strongly — either resistance (Love path harder) or reluctant acceptance (Corruption rise). Diary: “He doesn’t play fair. I should stay away. But…”

Renna ↔ Vagrant: Easily baited. Finds his manipulation “fun” at first. Diary: “He’s awful… but it’s fun to tease him back.”

Corruption Forks:

Vagrant sneaks unsolicited touches, dares, and taboo suggestions.

If a girl accepts → Corruption ↑ for her, Jealousy ↑ for the others.

If rejected → suspicion ↑, but Love path may deepen (he “respects her resistance”).


Pregnancy: 🔒 Locked until Stage 4.


---

Stage 3 — The Tipping Point

At this stage, tension peaks. If one girl lags behind, she becomes suspicious or excluded.

Aerith: Torn between genuine compassion and jealousy if Vagrant indulges Renna/Tifa. Diary: “Why does he look at her that way when I’m right here?”

Tifa: Either warms reluctantly (Love) or darkens (Corr). If jealous, her distrust flares into rivalry. Diary: “She’s so careless… I won’t lose to that.”

Renna: Begins to notice favoritism. Her naivety makes her either desperate to keep up (Corruption) or defensive (Jealousy). Diary: “Am I being left out? …No, he likes me too. Right?”


Outcomes:

Love Dominant: All three must build Love evenly → shared but fragile romance.

Corruption Dominant: Two or more bend → jealousy flips into acceptance → taboo bond begins.

Hybrid: Aerith reframes intimacy as tender but forbidden, Renna indulges with thrill, Tifa yields reluctantly.


Pregnancy: Still 🔒.


---

Stage 4 — Quad Convergence

By now, all three must be “ready” to progress. Affection/Corruption levels gate outcomes.

Possible Outcomes:

Healthy Split: If one girl resists (e.g. Tifa holds back), the others deepen their path. Splits leave rivalries or heartbreak.

Dark Trio/Quad: Corruption + Jealousy high → rivalry dissolves into collective taboo acceptance. Vagrant becomes the “axis” holding them.

Hybrid Quad: Love + Corruption → forbidden but cherished. Each girl frames the taboo differently:

Aerith: “I know it’s wrong, but he makes me feel alive.”

Tifa: “I can’t stop myself anymore. I want him.”

Renna: “Fufufu… it’s so naughty, but I love it.”



Pregnancy System:

🔓 Unlocked.

RNG applies per event, per girl (15–25% base chance).

Rare simultaneous pregnancies possible naturally.

Meta-rule: only Stage 4–5 girls can become pregnant.


Special Ending Progression:

“King of the Slums” locked until all female MCs (not just Aerith/Tifa/Renna) are corrupted + impregnated.



---

Stage 5 — Outcomes & Titles

Outcomes

1. Healthy Romance Split:

One or two walk away, the others pursue romance with Vagrant.



2. Rivalry Fallout:

Fractures deepen; one sides against the others. NPC gossip turns sharp.



3. Dark Trio/Quad Romance:

All three embrace corrupted bond → “Slum Harem.”

Pregnancies stagger via RNG, building a dysfunctional family.



4. Hybrid Shared Love:

Taboo becomes cherished. NPCs scandalized, diaries soften into guilty tenderness.



5. Special Harem Ending:

Quad arc contributes progress toward King of the Slums, but cannot unlock it alone.

System Notes

Love Score: Each girl progresses independently → tenderness, reform.

Corruption Score: Enables taboo acceptance → shared dark bonds.

Pregnancy RNG: Organic; simultaneous rare except scripted harem endings.

World Feedback: NPCs react differently based on dominant path:

Love: admiration + skepticism.

Corruption: fear, rumors of control.

Hybrid: scandal, whispers of thrill.


Meta Lock: King of the Slums requires all female MCs → quad is one step in that ladder.
